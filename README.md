- Real time chat application (using node.js, express, socket.io and deployed with Heroku) Originally this idea was taken from the next [book](https://www.manning.com/books/node-js-in-action) and was heavily simplified later on since our team made use of a modified version of the chat application found in the book for the subject "Design and testing" of our University. 

  - I made a [documentation](../../tree/master/Real_Time_Chat/Documentation(explanatory)/Documento%20A%2B%20Hackathon%20GRUPO%2023.pdf) for that same project explaining how it works.
