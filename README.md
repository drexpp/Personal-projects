Ideas

- Youtube video linker (using node.js, express, socket.io, youtube API, it also containings a simple really simple API replying with the avaliable rooms and deployed with Heroku) Made together with my partner [therealnosth](https://github.com/therealnosth)
  - **Have you ever wanted to watch a video with someone else at the same time?** [Project link](../../tree/master/Linked-Youtube-Player)
  - Deployed at [App link](https://obscure-wildwood-22526.herokuapp.com/)
  
- Real time chat application (using node.js, express, socket.io and deployed with Heroku) Originally this idea was taken from the next [book](https://www.manning.com/books/node-js-in-action) and was heavily simplified later on since our team made use of a modified version of the chat application found in the book for the subject "Design and testing" of our University. 

  - I made a [documentation](../../tree/master/Real_Time_Chat/Documentation(explanatory)/Documento%20A%2B%20Hackathon%20GRUPO%2023.pdf) for that same project explaining how it works.
  - [Project link](../../tree/master/Real_Time_Chat/Chat%20app)
  - Deployed at [App link](https://safe-atoll-72115.herokuapp.com/)
 
- Task list manager (developed using the default [react app structure](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app)) it consists on a basic SPA made using react in which you can add new tasks that you have to do.
   - [Project link](../../tree/master/TaskList)
   - Deployed at [App link](https://calm-retreat-82938.herokuapp.com/)
   
- Monga (An application for saving files online) (using node.js, express, passportjs (Login), multer and GridFs storage for file upload, mongoDB (and mongoose) for database and schemas). Made together with my partner [therealnosth](https://github.com/therealnosth)
